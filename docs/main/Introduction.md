## üëã Introduction

AgileTs is a global, simple, well-tested State Management Framework implemented in Typescript.
It offers a reimagined API that focuses on **developer experience** 
and allows you to **easily** manage your States.
Besides States, AgileTs offers some other powerful APIs that make your life easier.
The philosophy behind AgileTs is simple:

### üöÖ Straightforward

Write minimalistic, boilerplate-free code that captures your intent.
```ts
const MY_STATE = App.createState('frank'); // Create State
MY_STATE.set('jeff'); // Update State value
MY_STATE.undo(); // Undo latest State value change
MY_STATE.is({hello: "jeff"}); // Check if State has the value '{hello: "jeff"}'
MY_STATE.watch((value) => {console.log(value);}); // Watch on State changes
```

**Some more straightforward syntax examples:**

- Store State in any Storage, like the [Local Storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp)
  ```ts
  MY_STATE.persist("storage-key");
  ```
- Create a reactive Array of States
  ```ts
  const MY_COLLECTION = App.createCollection();
  MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 1, name: "Frank"});
  MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 2, name: "Dieter"});
  MY_COLLECTION.update(1, {name: "Jeff"});
  ```
- Compute State depending on other States
  ```ts
  const MY_INTRODUCTION = App.createComputed(() => {
     return `Hello I am '${MY_NAME.vale}' and I use ${MY_STATE_MANAGER.value} for State Management.`;
  });
  ```

### ü§∏‚Äç Flexible

- Works in nearly any UI-Layer. Check [here](Frameworks.md) if your preferred Framework is supported too.
- Surly behaves with the workflow which suits you best. No need for _reducers_, _actions_, ..
- Has **0** external dependencies

### ‚õ≥Ô∏è Centralize

AgileTs is designed to take all business logic out of UI-Components and put them in a central place, often called `core`.
The benefit of keeping logic separate to UI-Components is to make your code more decoupled, portable, scalable, and above all, easily testable.

### üéØ Easy to Use

Learn the powerful tools of AgileTs in a short amount of time. An excellent place to start are
our [Quick Start Guides](./Installation.md), or if you don't like to follow any tutorials,
you can jump straight into our [Example](../examples/Introduction.md) Section.


## ‚è≥ Quick Example

Instead of talking too much about the benefits of AgileTs,
we should rather see them in action.

### üòé Create State

```tsx
// -- core.js ------------------------------------------

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Instance of AgileTs
const App = new Agile();

// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create State with help of before defined Agile Instance
const MY_FIRST_STATE = App.createState("Hello Friend!");


// -- MyComponent.whatever ------------------------------------------

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Bind initialized State to desired UI-Component
// And wolla, it's reactive. Everytime the State mutates the Component rerenders
const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE); // Returns value of State ("Hello Friend!")
```

### ‚õ≥Ô∏è Sandbox

Test AgileTs yourself in a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/agilets-first-state-f12cz).
It's only one click away. Just select your preferred Framework below.

- [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/agilets-first-state-f12cz)
- [React-Native](https://snack.expo.io/@bennodev/agilets-first-state)
- [Vue](https://codesandbox.io/s/agilets-first-state-i5xxs)
- Angular (coming soon)

More examples can be found in the [Example Section](../examples/Introduction.md).

## üë®‚Äçüíª When using AgileTs

AgileTs is thought to handle the States of the business logic and logic in general that isn't explicitly bound to a Component.
This includes, for example, `server caching States` like the logged-in user. AgileTs wasn't built to handle UI States like `isModalOpen`.
Therefore, AgileTs should be used as a friend and helper to outsource all business logic from UI-Components.

## üü¶ Typescript

AgileTs is 99% written in Typescript and offers an excellent type-safety.

## üëÆ Data Flow

![Log Custom Styles Example](../../static/img/docs/data-flow.png)

#### `1`

In State-Management, the Data-Flow more or less starts and ends in the UI-Component.
For example, if we click a Button, we trigger an action that resolves in a UI change.
So by clicking a Theme Button, we start an action that changes the color theme of the current site.
In order that this color change can visibly happen, the Component has to rerender.
For this, we need to subscribe/bind the State (`THEME_STATE`) to the UI-Component,
with, for instance, the `useAgile()` hook.
Such subscription is essential to rerender the Component whenever the subscribed State mutates.
```ts
// ..
onClick={() => {
    toggleTheme();
}}
// ..
```

#### `2`

The action, triggered by the Theme Button,
then mutates the actual `THEME_STATE` and might do some side calculations.
We can also omit this step and edit the State directly in the UI-Component.
Everyone as he likes. However, I prefer separating UI-Component logic from global/business logic.
```ts
const toggleTheme = () => {
  THEME_STATE.invert();
}
```

#### `3`

Now we come to the inner workings of AgileTs,
i.e. what the actual AgileTs user no longer sees from the outside.
After the State has been mutated, it will notify the Observer.
Each State has its own Observer, which serves as an Interface to the Runtime
and keeps track of the subscribed UI-Components.
```ts
// ..
THEME_STATE.ingestValue(/* new value of THEME_STATE */);
// ..
```

#### `4`

The Observer then creates a Job and passes it to the Runtime.
The created Job has a reference to the Observer itself in order to perform the actual action
and rerender the correct UI-Components.
```ts
// ..
AgileInstance.runtime.ingest(ThemeStateChangeJob);
// ..
```

#### `5`

The main task of the Runtime is to queue Jobs and avoid race conditions.
It also combines rerender tasks if multiple Jobs try to rerender the same Component.
Firstly the Runtime processes all pending Jobs by calling a function in the Observer, which mutates the actual State value.
Also, it collects the rerender tasks of the individual Jobs.
If there are no more pending Jobs, it starts processing the rerender tasks.
```ts
// ..
job.observer.perform(job);
jobsToRerender.push(job);
// ..
```

#### `6`

A side effect of running a Job is the rerendering of subscribed Components.
Another could be the persisting into a permanent Storage or rebuilding the [Group](../packages/core/features/collection/group/Introduction.md) output.
```ts
// ..
subscriptionContainer.callback(); // If Component based Subscription
// ..
```

## üè¢ Structure of Documentation

### üìÅ AgileTs

You are currently in the `AgileTs` section, which serves as source for general topics like
the [Style Guide](./StyleGuide.md) or a general [Installation Guide](./Installation.md).

### üìÅ Quick Start

The `Quick Start` Section is all about how to get AgileTs up and running in different environments
like [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). In each Quick Start Guide the basics of some AgileTs
classes (like the [State](../packages/core/features/state/Introduction.md)) are covered too.

### üìÅ Packages

In the `packages` section all the AgileTs packages are listed. For instance the [core](../packages/core/Introduction.md) and
the [react](../packages/react/Introduction.md) package. If you click on one of them, it will reveal you an Introduction
about the package, an Installation Guide and all its features. In case of the [core](../packages/core/Introduction.md)
package you find the [State](../packages/core/features/state/Introduction.md)
and [Collection](../packages/core/features/collection/Introduction.md) documentation in the Features Section.
Be aware that `‚ö†Ô∏è WIP` isn't an actual package. It is meant to separate packages that are currently `work in progress`
and not ready for the outer world from the stable packages.

### üìÅ Examples

Some interactive examples can be found in the `example` section.

### üìÅ Interfaces

Without any context this Section might be useless to you. As the name suggests, it's all about typescript interfaces of
AgileTs, which are outsourced for a better overview. You might get redirected to parts of the Interface Section from
other documentation sections. Often to learn some more about specific properties of an interface.

## ü§ì Glossary

In these docs, we will refer to our classes with a capital first letter.
For example, when you see 'state', we refer to the programming concept `state`,
but when you see 'State', we are referring to our [State](../packages/core/features/state/Introduction.md) class.

### `Agile Sub Instance`
Instances that hold a reference to the [`Agile Instance`](../packages/core/features/agile-instance/Introduction.md)
and depend on its functionalities.
- [States](../packages/core/features/state/Introduction.md)
- [Collections](../packages/core/features/collection/Introduction.md)
- [Groups](../packages/core/features/collection/group/Introduction.md)
- [Selectors](../packages/core/features/collection/selector/Introduction.md)
- [Computed States](../packages/core/features/computed/Introduction.md)

### `Observer`

Interface to the [runtime](#runtime) which keeps track of subscribed UI-Components
and performs the actual State action executed by the runtime.

### `Runtime`

Queues and executes passed Jobs holding an [Observer](#observer) 
and performs rerender on subscribed UI-Components.

## üåè History of AgileTs

After exploring the many options of Javascript State libraries, including the popular Redux and MobX.
I felt like I need a simpler, more straightforward solution.
One day I accidentally stumbled across a stream from [@jamiepine](https://twitter.com/jamiepine).
Jamie was using an interesting approach of State Management which I haven't seen yet.
The Framework he used was PulseJs, the ancestor of AgileTs, so to speak.

I liked this concept of State Management a lot and started using it in my own projects.
At this point in time (spring 2020), it wasn't officially released.
Therefore, it was quite buggy and had no documentation. But I figured out how to use it anyway
and saved my finding in a small [pre-documentation](https://www.notion.so/bennoworkspace/Pulse-v3-No-official-Docs-4e92e8d02dd3423582fa95072806cab6) for PulseJs fellows.

The months went by, and no stable version came out. Not even an npm package.
In July, I came to the conclusion to contribute to PulseJs, in order to speed up the development process a bit.
But before I could do anything, I had to figure out how PulseJs works internally.
After hours, I still haven't figured out how it works. This was due to the fact that I was a Typescript noob,
and the codebase was not contributor friendly (No comments, variables called x, a, b, ..).
To learn how PulseJs works and to get a deeper understanding of Typescript,
I decided to rewrite PulseJs from scratch in a separate project, later AgileTs.
After a while, I got the hang and understood how PulseJs works under the hood.

Now that I knew how PulseJs works, I could finally start contributing.
My [first contribution](https://github.com/pulse-framework/pulse/commits?author=bennodev19) was on the 16th August 2020,
where I refactored the `PulseHOC`. Unfortunately, PulseJs was moving further and further away from my idea of an ideal State Management Framework.
For instance, they introduced the `Pulse.Core`, which more or less forced me to define all States, Actions in a single object called `core`.
I wouldn't say I liked that change since I switched, among other reasons, to PulseJs in order not to define all my States in a single object.
Because of this relatively significant design change, I would have to rebuild my entire State Management Logic of my applications.
Which I didn't want to do because I liked the old concept more.

Luckily I had the refactored PulseJs version lying around, which I created to learn how PulseJs works internally and released it as an own framework called
[agile-architecture](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agile-architecture).
Agile-Architecture was at that point just an old refactored version of PulseJs without the `Pulse.Core`.
Another reason I turned away from PulseJs, besides the different visions, was the leak of organization.
Some of my changes never got merged into the `master` branch. Why? Idk. But I am sure that it was not intentional.
For instance, I fixed an annoying `usePulse` type issue, and eight months later, it is still not merged into the `master`.
Why should I contribute if my changes, which fixed a problem I had, will never be in a release version?

Now that I had my own State Management Framework, I had more control and adapted it to my needs.
Over time AgileTs evolved away from PulseJs with other visions and goals.
During this time, I rewrote and optimized all internal classes, created tests, and wrote a documentation.
Today AgileTs has only a similar syntax to PulseJs. Internal, it works quite differently.

**Conclusion:** The idea of AgileTs is based on PulseJs, and I would have loved to continue working on PulseJs.
But certain circumstances, such as a poor organization and different visions,
have driven me to write my own State Manager based on the excellent ground concept of PulseJs and MVVM frameworks.
