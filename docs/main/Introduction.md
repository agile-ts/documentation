## üëã Introduction

AgileTs is a global, simple, well-tested State Management Framework implemented in Typescript.
It offers a reimagined API that focus on **developer experience** and allows you to **quickly** and **easily** manage your States.
Besides States, AgileTs offers other powerful classes which make your life easier.
The philosophy behind AgileTs is simple:

### üöÖ Straightforward
Write minimalistic, boilerplate-free code that captures your intent.

**Some straightforward syntax examples:**

- Mutate and Check States with simple Functions
  ```ts
  MY_STATE.undo(); // Undo latest change
  MY_STATE.is({hello: "jeff"}); // Check if State has the Value '{hello: "jeff"}'
  MY_STATE.watch((value) => {console.log(value);}); // Watch on State changes
  ```
- Store State in any Storage, like [Local Storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp)
  ```ts
  MY_STATE.persist("storage-key")
  ```
- Create a reactive Array of States
  ```ts
  const MY_COLLECTION = App.createCollection();
  MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 1, name: "Frank"});
  MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 2, name: "Dieter"});
  ```
- Compute State depending on other States
  ```ts
  const MY_INTRODUCTION = App.createComputed(() => {
     return `Hello I am '${MY_NAME.vale}' and I use ${MY_STATE_MANAGER.value} for State Management.`;
  });
  ```

### ü§∏‚Äç Flexible

- Works in nearly any UI-Layer. Check [here](Frameworks.md) if your preferred Framework is supported too.
- Surly behaves with the workflow which suits you best. No need for _reducers_, _actions_, ..
- Has **0** external dependencies

### ‚õ≥Ô∏è Centralize

AgileTs is designed to take all business logic out of UI-Components and put them in a central place often called `core`.
The benefit of keeping logic separate to UI-Components is to make your code more decoupled, portable and above all easily testable.

### üéØ Easy to Use

Learn the powerful tools of AgileTs in a short amount of time. An excellent place to start are
our [Quick Start](./Installation.md) Guides, or if you don't like following any tutorial, 
jump straight into our [Example](../examples) section.


## ‚è≥ Quick Example

Instead of talking too much about the benefits of AgileTs, let's start programming.

### üòé Our first State

```tsx
// -- core.js ------------------------------------------

// Let's start by creating an Instance of AgileTs
const App = new Agile();

// Now we are able to create our first State üòÉ
const MY_FIRST_STATE = App.createState("Hello Stranger!");


// -- myComponent.whatever ------------------------------------------

// Finally, we bind the just initialized State to our desired UI-Component
// And wolla, it's reactive. Everytime the State mutates the Component rerenders
const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE); // returns value of State ("Hello Stranger!")
```

To find out more, check out our [Quick Start Guides](./Installation.md).

More examples can be found in the [Example](../examples/Indroduction.md) Section.

## üë®‚Äçüíª When use AgileTs

AgileTs is thought to handle the business logic and logic in general that isn't explicitly bound to a Component of your application.
We recommend using AgileTs to manage global States and their logic at a central place.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Learn AgileTs

We have a variety of resources available to help you learn AgileTs. An excellent place to start are
our [Quick Start](./Installation.md) Guides, where you learn the basics about how to use AgileTs in a specific
Framework. After knowing the ground concept of AgileTs, we recommend checking out the [Style Guides](./StyleGuide.md).
The Style Guides will help you get some inspiration on structuring a scalable application using AgileTs. Now you
are ready to use AgileTs wherever you want. In case you need some more information about some functionalities of AgileTs,
use the search bar in the top right corner. In case you have any further questions don't hesitate to join our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/T9GzreAwPH).

## üè¢ Structure of Documentation

### üìÅ AgileTs

You are currently in the `AgileTs` section, which serves as source for general topics like
the [Style Guide](./StyleGuide.md) or an [Installation Guide](./Installation.md).

### üìÅ Quick Start

The `quick start` section is all about how to get AgileTs up and running in different environments
like [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). In each Quick Start Guide the basics of some AgileTs
classes ([State](../packages/core/features/state/Introduction.md), ..) are covered too.

### üìÅ Packages

In the `packages` section all the AgileTs packages are listed. For instance the [core](../packages/core/Introduction.md) and
the [api](../packages/api/Introduction.md) package. If you click on one of them, it will reveal you an Introduction
about the package, an Installation Guide and all its features. In case of the [core](../packages/core/Introduction.md)
package you find the [State](../packages/core/features/state/Introduction.md)
and [Collection](../packages/core/features/collection/Introduction.md) docs in the Features Section.
Be aware that `‚ö†Ô∏è WIP` isn't an actual package. It is meant to separate packages that are currently `work in progress` 
and not ready for the outer world.

### üìÅ Examples

Some interactive examples can be found in the `example` section.

### üìÅ Interfaces

Without any context this section might be useless to you. As the name suggests, it's all about typescript interfaces of
AgileTs, which are outsourced for a better overview. You might get redirected to parts of the Interface Section from
other docs. Often to learn some more about specific properties of an interface.

## ‚ùì Something missing

## üåè Creation of AgileTs

After exploring the many options for Javascript State libraries, including Redux.
I felt like I need a simpler, more straightforward solution.
So I started searching for Redux alternatives and accidentally stumbled across a stream from [@jamiepine](https://twitter.com/jamiepine).
Jamie was using an interesting approach of State Management which was more modular and flexible, called PulseJs.
I instantly fell in love with the syntax of this framework.
At this point (spring 2020) it wasn't officially released and had no documentation.
But I tried to figure out how to use it anyway, and after some painful hours, I got it to work in my React application.
To save others this time, I decided to write a small [pre-documentation](https://www.notion.so/bennoworkspace/Pulse-v3-No-official-Docs-4e92e8d02dd3423582fa95072806cab6) for PulseJs.
Unfortunately, this documentation didn't make PulseJs more stable, and it remained very buggy.
So I waited and waited until summer where still no stable version of PulseJs was released.
In July, I decided to contribute to PulseJs, in order to help to stabilize the framework faster.
But before I could contribute, I had to figure out how PulseJs works internally.
After hours, I still couldn't figure out how it works. This was due to the fact that I wasn't very experienced in Typescript,
and the codebase was pretty messy (no comments, variables called x, a, b, ..).
In order to change that, I rewrote PulseJs from scratch (in a separate project)
and after a while, I got the hang and figured out how PulseJs works internally.
Now that I know how it works, I could finally contribute to PulseJs. My [first contribution](https://github.com/pulse-framework/pulse/commits?author=bennodev19) was on the 16th August 2020,
where I refactored the `PulseHOC`.
At the end of August, PulseJs was moving further and further away from my idea of an ideal State Management Framework.
Mainly because of the introduction of the `Pulse.Core`,
which more or less forced you to define all States, Actions in a single object called `core`
and didn't work correctly at all.
I wouldn't say I liked that behavior since I mainly switched to PulseJs in order not to define all my States in a single object.
And I hadn't seen fit to rewrite my entire global State Management Logic of my applications to use the latest stable version of PulseJs.
Another reason I turned away, was that some of my changes never got merged into the `master`. For instance, I fixed an annoying usePulse type issue,
and 8 months later, it is still not in the `master`. Why should I contribute if my changes will never be in the release version?
Luckily I had the refactored PulseJs lying around, which I created to learn how PulseJs works internally and released it as an own framework called
[`agile-architecture`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agile-architecture).
Agile-Architecture was at that point just the old refactored PulseJs without the `Pulse.Core`.
I liked the old PulseJs more than the new PulseJs, so I stuck to my version of PulseJs.
Now that I had my own State Management Framework, I adapted it to my needs and optimized it.
Over time AgileTs has evolved away from PulseJs and can be seen as a standalone state management framework.
Today AgileTs has only a similar syntax to PulseJs. Internal, it works entirely different.

Conclusion: The idea of AgileTs is based on PulseJs, and I would have loved to continue working on PulseJs.
But the organisation was a mess, and I wasn't following the same vision anymore. 
Therefore, I created AgileTs. To make the things better that Pulse wasn't able to accomplish.

## üéâ Credits

AgileTs is inspired by MVVM frameworks like [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
and [PulseJs](https://github.com/pulse-framework/pulse).
