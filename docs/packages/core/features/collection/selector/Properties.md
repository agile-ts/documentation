:::info

Here are valuable properties of the `Selector Class` listed,
which aren't directly related to the [`State Class`](../../state/Introduction.md).

The Selector is an extension of the [`State Class`](../../state/Introduction.md)
and offers the same methods and properties as a normal State.
These State related methods aren't described in this Section.
To find out more about specific State methods, 
checkout the [State docs](../../state/Introduction.md).
