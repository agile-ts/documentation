## `integrate()`

Integrates a [Framework Integration](../integration/Introduction.md) into AgileTs.
An Integration simply tells AgileTs, how to mutates a particular Component whenever a State changes.
In order to bind States to UI-Components and thus be reactive, any Framework using AgileTs needs an Integration for AgileTs.
For example, to use AgileTs in a [React](https://reactjs.org/) environment,
we have to integrate/register the [React Integration](../../../react/Introduction.md).
```ts
App.integrate(reactIntegration);
```

### ðŸ“­ Props

| Prop            | Type                                                              | Default   | Description                                                 | Required |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `integration`   | [Integration](../integration/Introduction.md)                     | undefined | Integration that gets registered/integrated into AgileTs    | Yes      |

### ðŸ“„ Return

```ts

```

## `registerStorage()`

:::warning

The `registerStorage()` method has been deprecated in the latest version `^0.2.0`
and is no longer available!

### Why?

### Alternative?
A storage can now be registered with the shared [`Storage Manager`](../storage/Introduction.md),
which manages all Storages for AgileTs.
```ts {15}
import {getSharedStorageManager, createStorage} from "@agile-ts/core";

// Create an interface to the Local Storage
const _localStorage = createStorage({
    key: 'localStorage',
    async: false,
    methods: {
       get: localStorage.getItem.bind(localStorage),
       set: localStorage.setItem.bind(localStorage),
       remove: localStorage.removeItem.bind(localStorage),
    },
});

// Register Storage to the shared Storage Manager
getSharedStorageManager().register(_localStorage, { default: true }); 
```
