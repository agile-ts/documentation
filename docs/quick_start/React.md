Welcome to the [React](https://www.reactjs.org) quick start guide. 
**This tutorial will briefly introduce you to AgileTs
and teach you how to use its fundamental functionalities in a React environment.**
By the time you finish this guide, you will be able to start building your own AgileTs applications.
We recommend proceeding from top to bottom, as some parts of the tutorial build on each other.

## üîΩ Installation

Let's start with the installation. If you haven't intended to install AgileTs yet,
you can skip the installation guide and jump straight into the '[Create first State](#-create-first-state)' tutorial.

In order to use AgileTs in a React environment, we need to install two packages.
- [`@agile-ts/core`](#-agile-tscore)
- [`@agile-ts/react`](#-agile-tsreact)

When you have planned to set up a new project from scratch using AgileTs and React,
feel free to use the official AgileTs + React template from `create-react-app`.
This will automatically generate a fully functional React app with AgileTs installed.

<Tabs
defaultValue="javascript"
values={[
{label: 'Javascript', value: 'javascript'},
{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},
]}>
<TabItem value="javascript">

     npx create-react-app my-app --template agile

   </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript">

     npx create-react-app my-app --template agile-typescript

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Otherwise, you can install the `@agile-ts/core` and `@agile-ts/react` packages directly 
into your existing React application.

### üìÅ `@agile-ts/core`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @agile-ts/core 
```
The [`core`](../packages/core/Introduction.md) package contains the State Management Logic of AgileTs
and therefore provides powerful classes like the [`State Class`](../packages/core/api/state/Introduction.md).

### üìÇ `@agile-ts/react`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @agile-ts/react 
```
The [React Integration](../packages/react/Introduction.md), on the other hand, 
is an interface to React and provides useful functionalities
such as the [`useAgile()`](../packages/react/api/Hooks.md#useagile) hook 
to bind States to React Components for reactivity.

## üí° Create first State

After we have successfully set up a project with AgileTs installed, 
we can start creating our first AgileTs State.
But first things first, what is a State in AgileTs?

### ‚ùì What is a State

A `State` represents a piece of Information that we need to remember globally at a later point in time.
Such information can be the current theme or the logged-in user,
which we have to access in multiple React Components.
All we need to instantiate a State, is to call `createState()` and specify an initial value.
```ts
const MY_FIRST_STATE = createState("Hello World");
```
Now that we have instantiated our first State, 
we can dynamically and easily manipulate its value.
```ts
// Update State value to 'Hello There'
MY_FIRST_STATE.set("Hello There");

// Undo latest change (-> Value is now "Hello World" again)
MY_FIRST_STATE.undo();

// Permanently store State value in an external Storage
MY_FIRST_STATE.persist();
```


### üî¥ Live Example {#live-example-1}

To get a better understanding of how to use an AgileTs State in React, we should try it out.
Therefore, we have created a Live Example, 
where we can see a [AgileTs State](../packages/core/api/state/Introduction.md) in action.
The sample project we'll look at is a small counter 
that lets us increment a number as we click the 'Update State' button.
It may not be fascinating, 
but it shows all the essential pieces of a React + AgileTs application in action.
After playing a bit with the Live Example, 
we recommend taking a look at the [Important Code Snippets Section](#important-code-snippets-1) below.
There important code snippets related to AgileTs are described in more detail.
In case you have any further questions, 
don't hesitate to join our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/T9GzreAwPH).
```tsx live
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create State with the initial value "Hello World"
const MY_FIRST_STATE = createState("Hello World");

let helloWorldCount = 0;
const RandomComponent = () => {
    // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bind initialized State to 'RandomComponent' for reactivity
    const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{myFirstState}</p>
            <button
                onClick={() => {
                    // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Update State value on Button press
                    MY_FIRST_STATE.set(`Hello World ${++helloWorldCount}`);
                }}
            >
                Update State
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

render(<RandomComponent/>);
```

### üíª Important Code Snippets {#important-code-snippets-1}

```ts
const MY_FIRST_STATE = createState("Hello World");
```
1Ô∏è‚É£ All you need to instantiate a State, is to call `createState()` and specify an initial value.
In our example, we have assigned the initial value 'Hello World' to the State. 
If you are wondering why we write AgileTs States uppercase. 
Well, it has a simple advantage.
We can easily differentiate between global 
and local States in our UI-Components (See Step 3Ô∏è‚É£).

```ts
const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE); // Returns 'Hello World [x_number]'
```
Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£ Now, we bind the previously created 'Hello World' State to the React Component 
using the [`useAgile()`](../packages/react/api/Hooks.md#useagile) Hook.
This binding ensures that the React Component re-renders whenever the current State `value` changes.
`useAgile()` returns the current `value` of the State.
So in our case something like 'Hello World [x_number]'.

```ts
MY_FIRST_STATE.set(`Hello World ${++helloWorldCount}`);
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ To bring some life into our small application, 
we update the State `value` with the help of the State's `.set()` function 
on each 'Update State' button press. 
Thereby we increase the external set `helloWorldCount` in ascending order.

### üò± Troubleshooting

#### Component doesn't re-render when State mutates.
Such a problem can occur when the automatic integration of React has failed.
Often it helps to manually integrate the React integration into the Agile Instance to which the State belongs. 
In our case that would be the internal [`shared` Agile Instance](../packages/core/api/agile-instance/Introduction.md#-shared-agile-instance).
```ts
import {shared} from "@agile-ts/core";
import reactIntegration from "@agile-ts/react";

shared.integrate(reactIntegration);
```

## üîç Next Steps

The concepts we've covered in this tutorial should be enough to get you started building
your own applications using React and AgileTs. 
Now is a good time to try working on a project yourself to solidify 
these learned concepts and see how they work in practice.
If you're not sure what kind of project to create, 
see [this list of app project ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) for some inspiration.
Before you jump straight into creating your own application, 
we suggest taking a look at our [Style Guide](../main/StyleGuides.md) documentation.
There we give you some inspiration on 
how to properly structure your application States using AgileTs.
