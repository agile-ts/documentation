A `Collection` represents a reactive _set_ of Information 
that we need to remember globally at a later point in time.
While offering a toolkit to use and mutate this _set_ of Information.
It is designed for arrays of `data objects` following the same pattern.
Each of these data objects must have a **unique `primaryKey`** to be correctly identified later.
All you need to instantiate a Collection, is to call `createCollection()` and specify an initial value.
```ts
const MY_COLLECTION = createCollection();
```
We can create as many Collections as we want and bind them dynamically to any UI-Component. 
Now that we have instantiated a Collection, we can dynamically and easily manipulate its value.
```ts
// Add new Item to Collection
MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 1, name: "jeff"}); 

// Remove Item at id '1' from Collection
MY_COLLECTION.remove(1).everywhere(); 

// Permanently store Collection value in an external Storage
MY_COLLECTION.persist();

// Reset Collection
MY_COLLECTION.reset(); 
```
Want to learn more about the State's specific methods? Check out the [Collection Methods](./Methods.md) documentation. 
Most methods we use to modify, mutate and access the State are chainable.
```ts
MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 1, name: "jeff"}).persist().removeGroup('myGroup').reset();
```


### üëæ Advantages over Array State
- reactive
- each `Item` is an actual reactive [State](../state/Introduction.md)
- efficient persisting in an external Storage 
- neat api (`undo()`, `reset()`, `patch()`)
- categorize data with help of [Groups](#-groupgroupintroductionmd)
- select specific Item with help of [Selector](#-selectorselectorintroductionmd)
- performant (‚ö†Ô∏è coming there)


### üî® Use case
We might use a Collection to remember a flexible array of Todo objects.
```ts
const TODOS = App.createCollection();
// <- add todos
TODOS.collect({id: 1, todo: "Clean bathroom"}, ["user1"]);
TODOS.collect({id: 2, todo: "Write Agile docs"},  ["user1"]);
// <- cleaned bathroom
TODOS.remove(1).everywhere();
```
In the example above, we create an empty `TODO` Collection.
After the instantiation, we add two todo items to the Collection
and specify that both todo items remain to the `user1` [Group](#-groupgroupintroductionmd).
We do that to keep track of which todo relates to which user.
Now that we `cleaned our bathroom`,
we remove the todo related to the id `1` from the Collection and all Groups (-> everywhere).

## üóÇ Collection Classes

A Collection consists of several classes, 
all of which play an essential role.


### üîπ Item

Each data object we add to a Collection (for example, via the `collect()` method)
will be automatically transformed to an `Item` 
and stored directly in a so-called `data` object of the Collection.
```ts title="data object"
{
  99: Item(99) // has value '{id: 99, name: "frank"}'
  1: Item(1)  // has value '{id: 1, name: "jeff"}'
  2: Item(2) // has value '{id: 2, name: "hans"}'
}
```
An `Item` is an extension of the [State Class](../state/Introduction.md)
and represents one piece of data object of the Collection.
Since the `Item` is an extension of the State, 
it provides the same powerful functionalities as a State.
```ts
// Collect Data
MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 1, name: "jeff"}); 

// Get Item at itemKey '1'
const myItem = MY_COLLECTION.getItem(1); // Returns Item at primaryKey '1'
myItem.value; // Returns '{id: 1, name: "jeff"}'

// Update property 'name' in Item
myItem.patch({name: "frank"});

// Undo latest Item value change
myItem.undo(); 
```


### üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ [Group](./group/Introduction.md)

Often applications need to categorize and preserve the ordering of structured data.
In AgileTs, Groups are the cleanest way to do so.
They allow us to cluster together data from a Collection as an array of `item Keys`.
```ts
const MY_GROUP = MY_COLLECTION.createGroup("groupName", [/* initial Items */]);
```
By default, each collected data object will be added to the `default` Group, 
representing the default Collection pattern.
Keep in mind, that a Group doesn't store the Item itself. 
It only holds an array of primaryKeys like a keymap of the data it represents.
```ts
MY_COLLECTION.getGroup('default').output; // Returns '[{id: 1, name: 'jeff'}]'
// Returns the same as:
MY_COLLECTION.getAllItemValues(); // Returns '[{id: 1, name: 'jeff'}]'
```
A Group is an extension of the `State Class` and offers the same powerful functionalities.
```ts
// Undo latest Group value change
MY_STATE.undo();

// Reset Group to its intial Value
MY_GROUP.reset();

// Permanently store Group value in an external Storage
MY_STATE.persist(); 
```
However, there is an essential difference to a State.
Since the expected Group value isn't cached in the `value` property 
but in the `output` property. 
That is due the fact that the `value` property represents the actual value of the Group
and is used to keep track of the `itemKeys` that the Group represents.
The Group `output` is the cached values for the Items the Group represents.
```ts
MY_GROUP.value; // Returns [1, 20, 5]
MY_GROUP.output; // Returns (see below)
/* [
     {id: 1, name: "frank"}, 
     {id: 20, name: "jeff"}, 
     {id: 5, name: "hans"}
    ]
*/
```
For example, we can use a Group to cluster a Post Collection into 'User Posts' of the different users.
```ts
// Add userA, userB to USERS Collection
USERS.collect([userA, userB]);

// Add userA Posts and cluster it by the UserA id
POSTS.collect(userA.posts, userA.id);

// Add userB Posts and cluster it by the UserB id
POSTS.collect(userB.posts, userB.id);

// Returns '[1, 2, 6]' (UserA Posts)
POSTS.getGroup(userA.id).value;

// Returns '[3, 10, 20]' (UserB Posts)
POSTS.getGroup(userB.id).value;

// Returns '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, ..]' (All Posts)
POSTS.getGroup('default').value; 
```
In the above code snippet, we have two Collections, one for users and another for posts.
We can collect posts specific to a user and automatically group them by the user's id.


### üîÆ [Selector](./selector/Introduction.md)

Sometimes we need access to one specific `Item` of a Collection in the long term.
Therefore, AgileTs offers the Selector Class, 
which allows the easy selection of one specific Item from the Collection.
```ts
const MY_SELECTOR = MY_COLLECTION.createSelector(/* to select primary Key */);
```
A Selector is an extension of the `State Class` and offers the same powerful functionalities.
```ts
MY_SELECTOR.patch({name: "frank"}); // Update property 'name' in Item
```
For example, a Selector finds its use, to select the currently logged-in user of a User Collection.
```ts
const CURRENT_USER = USERS.select(/* current logged-in userId */);
```
If the currently logged-in user logs out and logs in with another user,
we can easily update the `Item` (User) that the Selector represents.
```ts
CURRENT_USER.select(/* new logged-in userId */);
```


## üì≠ Props

```ts
new Collection(agileInstance, config);
// or
App.createCollection(config);
// or 
createCollection(config);
```

### `config`

A `Collection` takes an optional configuration object as its only parameter.
There are two different ways of configuring a Collection. Both have their advantages.

- **1.** The plain _object_ way, which is notorious for its ease of use.
  Here, we configure everything in a specific object. For instance, this makes the creation of Instances like Groups pretty straightforward.
  But on the other hand, it gives us some limitations, since we aren't creating and configuring the Groups and Selectors on our own.
  The Collection takes care of it instead.
     ```ts
     App.createCollection({
       key: 'dummyCollection',
       group: ["dummyGroup"]
     })
     ```

- **2.** The _function_ way, where a function, which has the Collection as the first parameter, returns the configuration object.
  This gives us more freedom in configuring Instances like Groups,
  because we have access to the Collection and can create them on our own.
     ```ts
     App.createCollection((collection) => ({
       key: 'dummyCollection',
       group: {
          dummyGroup: collection.Group(["item1", "item2"])
        }
     }))
     ```

Here is a Typescript Interface for quick reference. However,
each property is explained in more detail below.
```ts
export interface CreateCollectionConfigInterface<DataType = DefaultItem> {
  groups?: { [key: string]: Group<any> } | string[];
  selectors?: { [key: string]: Selector<any> } | string[];
  key?: CollectionKey;
  primaryKey?: string;
  defaultGroupKey?: GroupKey;
  initialData?: Array<DataType>;
}
```

#### `groups`
Our Collection's initial [Groups](#-groupgroupintroductionmd) are defined with this property's help.
There are two different ways of doing so.
The first one is to pass an Array of Group keys/names,
where AgileTs takes care of the Group's creation and names them according to the passed keys.
```ts
App.createCollection({
  groups: ["myGroup1", "myGroup2"]
});
```
The way mentioned above has some limitations, since we can't configure the Groups ourselves.
Fortunately, there is a second way where we have access to the Collection itself,
and can define and configure the Groups on our own.
```ts
App.createCollection((collection) => ({
  key: 'dummyCollection',
  group: {
    myGroup1: collection.Group(["item1", "item2"], {/* some configuration */}),
    myGroup2: collection.Group(["item5", "item2", "item6"])
  }
}));
```

| Type                                                 | Default     | Required |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| `{ [key: string]: Group<DataType> }  \| string[]`    | {}          | No       |

<br/>

#### `selectors`
Our Collection's initial [Selectors](#-selectorselectorintroductionmd) are defined with this property's help.
As with the `groups` property, there are two different ways of doing so.
The first one is to pass an Array of Selector keys/names,
where AgileTs takes care of the Selector's creation and names them according to the passed keys.
```ts
App.createCollection({
  selectors: ["mySelector1", "mySelector2"]
});
```
The way mentioned above has some limitations, since we can't configure the Selectors ourselves.
Fortunately, there is a second way where we have access to the Collection itself,
and can define and configure the Selectors on our own.
```ts
App.createCollection((collection) => ({
  key: 'dummyCollection',
  selectors: {
    mySelector1: collection.Selector("item1", {/* some configuration */}),
    mySelector2: collection.Selector("item3")
  }
}));
```

| Type                                                 | Default     | Required |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| `{ [key: string]: Selector<DataType> }  \| string[]` | {}          | No       |

<br/>

#### `key`
The optional property `key/name` should be a unique `string/number` to identify the Collection later.
```ts
App.createCollection({
  key: "myKey"
});
```
We recommend giving each Collection a unique `key`, since it has only advantages:
- helps us during debug sessions
- makes it easier to identify the Collection
- no need for separate persist Key

| Type               | Default     | Required |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| `string \| number` | undefined   | No       |

<br/>

#### `primaryKey`
Defines which property's value in collected data is selected as `primaryKey`.
By default, it is `id`. A `primaryKey` identifies a specific Item and has to be part of each collected data.
```ts
const MY_COLLECTION = App.createCollection({
  primaryKey: "key"
});
MY_COLLECTION.collect({key: 1, name: "hans"});
//                      ^
//                      |
// primary Key ----------
```

| Type               | Default     | Required |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| `string \| number` | 'id'        | No       |

<br/>

#### `defaultGroupKey`
Describes the `key/name` of the default [Group](#-groupgroupintroductionmd).
By default, it is `default`.
```ts
App.createCollection({
  defaultGroupKey: "allItemsOfCollectionKey"
});
```
The default Group represents all Items of the Collection.

| Type               | Default     | Required |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| `string \| number` | 'default'   | No       |

<br/>

#### `initialData`
Here we can set the initial Data of our Collection.
```ts
App.createCollection({
  initialData: [{id: 1, name: "hans"}, {id: 2, name: "frank"}]
});
```

| Type               | Default     | Required |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| `Array<DataType>`  | []          | No       |


## üü¶ Typescript

A `Collection` is almost 100% typesafe and takes an optional generic type for type safety
that has to be followed by each collected data object.
```ts {6}
interface UserInterface {
  id: number,
  name: string
}

const MY_COLLECTION = App.createState<UserInterface>();
MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: "invalidType", animal: "Lion"}); // type Error
MY_COLLECTION.collect({id: 1, name: "hans"}); // Success
```
