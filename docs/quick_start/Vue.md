**Vue is currently not supported.**

In case you are familiar with Vue, feel free to create an AgileTs Integration for VueJs. 
Checkout the [React Integration](https://github.com/agile-ts/agile/blob/master/packages/react/src/react.integration.ts)
or the [Integration](../packages/core/features/integration/Introduction.md) Guide to learn more about how to integrate
AgileTs into another Framework. We persuade each contribution! Thanks ^^
