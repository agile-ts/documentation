The `Agile Class` is the internal manager of AgileTs and should be unique to your application.
```ts
const App = new Agile();
```
It can be seen as an interface to any external Storage, 
or the UI-Frameworks AgileTs is implemented in.
Also, contains it a job queue system for managing State mutations.
Each `Agile Sub Instance` (ASI) contains a reference to the `Agile Class` 
and depends on its functionalities.
For reference, here are some `Agile Sub Instances` (ASI) 
created with an instantiated `Agile Instance` called `App`:

- [State](../state/Introduction.md)
  ```ts
   const MY_STATE = new State(App, "Hello there");
   // exuals to
   const MY_STATE = App.createState("Hello there");
   ```
- [Collection](../collection/Introduction.md)
   ```ts
   const MY_COLLECTION = new Collection(App);
   // exuals to
   const MY_COLLECTION = App.createCollection();
   ```
- [Computed](../computed/Introduction.md)
   ```ts
   const MY_COMPUTED = new Computed(App, () => 'hello');
   // exuals to
   const MY_COMPUTED = App.createComputed(() => 'hello');
   ```

In summary the main tasks of the `Agile Class` are to:
- queue [`Agile Sub Instance`](../../../../main/Introduction.md#agile-sub-instance)
  changes in the `runtime` to prevent race conditions
- update/rerender subscribed UI-Components through the provided Integrations
  such as the [React Integration](../../../react/Introduction.md)
- integrate with the persistent [Storage](../storage/Introduction.md)
- provide configuration object


## ü§ù `shared` Agile Instance

In most cases you won't come in direct contact with the hidden helper (Agile Instance), 
although everything depends on it.
That is due the fact that there exists a shared Agile Instance called `shared` in the background.
The shared Instance allows the easy and straightforward creation of ASI's, 
such as the State below.
```ts
const MY_STATE = createState('Created with hidden Agile Instance');
MY_STATE.agileInstance(); // Returns `shared` Agile Instance
```
This is sufficient in 90% of cases, 
but if you want to configure the Agile Instance in more detail, 
you have to redefine it.
```ts
const App = new Agile({/* many config optionas */});
```
Once you have created your own Agile Instance,
we recommend that you overwrite the `shared` Agile Instance
with the newly created Agile Instance.
```ts
assignSharedAgileInstance(App);
```
Otherwise, there would exist two instances of Agile 
which is an unnecessary use of memory.

## üì≠ Props

### `config`

The `Agile Class` takes an optional configuration object as its only parameter.
```ts
new Agile({
    logConfig: {
        active: true,
    },
    localStorage: false
});
```
Here is a Typescript Interface for quick reference. However,
each property is explained in more detail below.
```ts
export interface CreateAgileConfigInterface {
  logConfig?: CreateLoggerConfigInterface;
  localStorage?: boolean;
  waitForMount?: boolean;
  bindGlobal?: boolean;
}
```

#### `key`
The optional property `key/name` should be a unique `string/number` to identify the Agile Instance later.
```ts
new Agile({
    key: "myKey"
});
```

| Type            | Default     | Required |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `string`        | undefined   | No       |

<br/>

#### `logConfig`
The `logConfig` defines the configuration object for the Logger of AgileTs.
The Agile Logger simply logs important events in the console, like warnings or errors,
but it can also log runtime events if that is desired.
```ts
new Agile({
  logConfig: {
    level: Logger.level.ERROR, // print only errors
    active: true,
    timestamp: true // print a timestamp before each log
  },
});
```
To find out more about possible configuration options, checkout the [CreateLoggerConfigInterface](../../../../Interfaces.md#createloggerconfig).

| Type                                                                           | Default                                                          | Required |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [`CreateLoggerConfigInterface`](../../../../Interfaces.md#createloggerconfig)  | {prefix: 'Agile', active: true, level: Logger.level.WARN}        | No       |

<br/>

#### `localStorage`
Whether AgileTs should create an interface to the [Local Storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp) and set it as default Storage.
Each [Agile Sub Instance](../../../../main/Introduction.md#agile-sub-instance) we persist (`.persist()`), will then be stored in the `localStorage` by default.
```ts
new Agile({
  localStorage: false // default true
});
```
We aren't limited to the `localStorage` and can create Interfaces to nearly any [Storage](../storage/Introduction.md) we prefer saving data in.
For instance, that is necessary for a Mobile Environment since the `localStorage` doesn't exist, and we have to resort to the Async Storage.
With `App.registerStorage()` we register a new [Storage](../storage/Introduction.md) to AgileTs.

| Type            | Default     | Required |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `boolean`       | true        | No       |

<br/>

#### `waitForMount`
This flag declares whether AgileTs should wait until unmounted Components get mounted before trigger rerenders on them.
```ts
new Agile({
  waitForMount: false // default true
});
```

| Type            | Default     | Required |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `boolean`       | true        | No       |

<br/>

#### `bindGlobal`
Whether the Agile Instance should be bound [globally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis) at the key `__agile__`.
```ts
new Agile({
  bindGlobal: false // default false
});
```
A globally bound Agile Instance has some advantages:
- If methods such as `useAgile()` can't find any Agile Instance in the given Instances, 
  they fall back on the global Agile Instance.
- You can simply access it in the console for debugging purpose.

| Type            | Default     | Required |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `boolean`       | false       | No       |

<br/>

#### `autoIntegrate`
Whether external added Integrations are to integrate automatically into the Agile Instance.
```ts
new Agile({
  autoIntegrate: false // default true
});
```
For example, when the package `@agile-ts/react` was installed,
whether to automatically integrate the `reactIntegration`.
```ts
const App = new Agile({autoIntegrate: true});
// React got automatically integrated into the Agile Instance

// --

const App = new Agile({autoIntegrate: false});
// React didn't get automatically integrated into the Agile Instance
// -> We have to integrate it manually
App.integrate(reactIntegration);
```


## üåé Where to instantiate?

If you have decided to initialize an Agile Instance
and don't want to use the `shared` one.
You can technically instantiate it anywhere.
However, there are a few [Style Guides](../../../../main/StyleGuide.md)
which might help you with your decision.


## üü¶ Typescript

The `Agile Class` is almost 100% typesafe.
